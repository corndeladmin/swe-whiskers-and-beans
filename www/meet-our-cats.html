Mittens
The cafe’s dignified elder statescat, Mittens is a regal Maine Coon with tufted ears and a luxurious coat. His favorite spot is the sun-soaked windowsill, where he surveys the bustling street outside with an air of wisdom. Patrons often find solace in his calm presence and gentle purring.

Saffron
A mischievous tabby with striking amber eyes, Saffron is the cafe’s resident acrobat. She can be found perched atop the highest bookshelf, swatting at imaginary butterflies or playfully batting at dangling yarn. Her antics never fail to entertain both humans and fellow cats.
