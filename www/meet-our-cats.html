Mittens
The cafe’s dignified elder statescat, Mittens is a regal Maine Coon with tufted ears and a luxurious, snow-white coat. His favorite spot is the sun-soaked windowsill, where he surveys the bustling street outside with an air of wisdom. Patrons often find solace in his calm presence and gentle purring.

Saffron
A mischievous tabby with striking amber eyes, Saffron is the cafe’s resident acrobat. She can be found perched atop the highest bookshelf, swatting at imaginary butterflies or playfully batting at dangling yarn. Her antics never fail to entertain both humans and fellow cats.

Espresso
True to his name, Espresso is a sleek, jet-black Bombay cat with an affinity for caffeine. He insists on sampling every cup of coffee that passes his way, often dipping his paw into frothy lattes. His glossy coat gleams as he weaves between tables, leaving a trail of curiosity in his wake.

Luna
Luna, the cafe’s resident Siamese, is a vocal and affectionate soul. Her azure eyes seem to hold secrets from distant lands, and she enjoys curling up on laps while patrons sip their drinks. Luna’s favorite pastime? Gazing out the window, dreaming of moonlit adventures.

Whisker
A playful ginger kitten, Whisker is the cafe’s newest addition. His boundless energy keeps everyone on their toes as he zooms through the cafe, chasing invisible mice and pouncing on unsuspecting shoelaces. Whisker’s tiny pink nose and oversized whiskers have stolen many hearts.
